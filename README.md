# Bundesrecht Scraper

Github Action based scraper capturing changes to Bundesrecht at [gesetze-im-internet.de](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/).

This repository contains a Github Action that runs on a daily basis and scrapes the publicly available Bundesrecht.
The scraper then commits the changes (if there are any) to this repository, so that analysis over time is possible.

This project is inspired by Simon Willison's [Git Scraping](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/).
